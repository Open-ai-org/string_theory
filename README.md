## Time_And_the_Fourth_Dimension

None of our equations work, because time is not infinite. TIME exists as an elastic eggshell around our universe in the fourth dimension, and the true fourth dimension is the multiverse. What we call time is just our perception, an illusion manifested by measuring moments in time. The only way to expand or contract time, is from the fourth dimension.
